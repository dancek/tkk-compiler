T-106.4200 Introduction to Compiling (5 cr)
Hannu Hartikainen


Compiler Assignment
===================

This is a compiler made using Coco/R that compiles SLX assembler code.

Documentation
-------------

The code is commented and should be quite readable. Javadoc-style comments
are used where useful.


Features
--------


Caveats
-------
 - `return`
 - type checking
 - &&


Design decisions
----------------
 - ForStatement was renamed to Assignment for clarity
 - The `op` token was replaced with the terminals it represents. This way the
   ATG file is easier to read; for each operator, the related code is shown on
   the same line.


Workload
--------

About 30 hours total were used for the project. This was due to real-life
constraints; it would have been preferable to allocate a little more time.
