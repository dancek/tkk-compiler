T-106.4200 Introduction to Compiling (5 cr)
Hannu Hartikainen


Compiler Assignment
===================

This is a compiler made using Coco/R that compiles SLX assembler code.

Documentation
-------------

The code is commented and should be quite readable. Javadoc-style comments
are used where useful.


Features
--------

### for loop

The for loop works like usual, i.e. the loop is like

    for(a;b;c)
      d;

and execution flows like

        a;
    test:
        if (b) goto loop;
        else goto end;
    incr:
        c;
        goto test;
    loop:
        d;
        goto incr;
    end:

Note that to get d; to run before c; we need to be jumping around all the time!
It would have been easier to just let c; run in the beginning of the loop, but
that's not what programmers are used to.


Caveats
-------
 - `return`
 - type checking
 - &&


Design decisions
----------------
 - ForStatement was renamed to Assignment for clarity
 - The `op` token was replaced with the terminals it represents. This way the
   ATG file is easier to read; for each operator, the related code is shown on
   the same line.


Workload
--------

About 30 hours total were used for the project. This was due to real-life
constraints; it would have been preferable to allocate a little more time.
