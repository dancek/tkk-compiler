Hannu Hartikainen


Compiler Assignment
===================

This is a compiler made using Coco/R that compiles SLX assembler code.

Documentation
-------------

The code is commented and should be quite readable. Javadoc-style comments
are used where useful.


Features
--------


Caveats
-------
 - `return`
 - type checking

Workload
--------

About 30 hours total were used for the project. This was due to real-life
constraints; it would have been preferable to allocate a little more time.
